embedded midi is a library written by Alex Norman.

This project used to be called avr-midi but it should be useful for other C
projects, thought it is intended for embedded work, so that is why it has been
renamed.

It is licenced with the GPL v3 licence, see the file "COPYING" for more info.

Please send me bug info, bug fixes, general improvements, etc.  alex@x37v.info

This is the development version which has only been tested on a atmega32u2.
