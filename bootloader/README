This is sysex_boot by Alex Norman [http://www.x37v.info]

REQUIREMENTS:
	avr-gcc
	portmidi
	g++

OVERVIEW:

there are 2 components to this project, the avr_code and the uploader

the avr_code needs to be loaded onto your microcontroller.. edit
avr_code/bootloadercfg.h as appropriate [setting the bootloader entry condition, etc].

the uploader takes binary files [see the example for main.bin] and uploads them to the
microcontroller.

make sure that your microcontroller is in bootloader mode and has both the midi
ins and outs conected to your computer.


EXAMPLE:

once you've programmed your microcontroller and you've built your uploader do this:
cd example/
make
cd ../uploader/
./sysexupload ../example/main.bin

this will prompt you for some information and then upload the example program
to your microcontroller
