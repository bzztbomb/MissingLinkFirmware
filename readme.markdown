# Intro

This branch of the WiSheildOSC code is focused on support The Missing Link.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YarIPK-gwbw&feature=player_embedded this branch will focus on ease of use for that device and will likely strip away all unneeded code/examples (and change the uIP stack)

# Todo

* Add /midi extended message support.
